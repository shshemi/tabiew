## Wiki

Tabiew started as a humble hobby TUI project for viewing CSV data but has evolved to incorporate various features and improvements from valuable community feedbacks. As the project expanded, so did the need for comprehensive documentation, leading to the creation of the [wiki page](https://github.com/shshemi/tabiew/wiki). The wiki offers explanations of features and the best practices to get the most out of Tabiew.

## Usage

Start Tabiew with `tw`

tw <path_to_csv(s)>
```

To open TSV file(s), use:
```bash
tw --tsv <path_to_tsv(s)>
```

Alternatively, you can manually specify the separator and header options:
```bash
tw <path_to_tsv(s)> --separator $'\t' --no-header
```

To open parquet file(s), use:
```bash
tw <path_to_parquet(s)> -f parquet
